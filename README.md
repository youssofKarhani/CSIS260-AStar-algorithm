# CSIS260-AStar-algorithm
A web based application for shortest path-finding, using AStar algorithm.
Scripting language: JavaScript.
The algorithm runs when the User inserts the start position and the end position by clicking on the map.
Once initialized, the algorithm will procced to apply the AStar algorithm until the it reachs the destination, 
where a yellow line will be drawn indicating the shortest path.
If not reached, then the end position is unreachable from the start position and no yellow line will be drawn.
